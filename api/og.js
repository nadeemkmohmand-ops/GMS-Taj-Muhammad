// api/og.js
// Vercel Serverless Function — returns fully-formed static HTML with the
// correct <title>, <meta description>, Open Graph, Twitter Card, canonical,
// and JSON-LD tags for a given path. middleware.ts routes known social
// media crawlers (WhatsApp, Facebook, LinkedIn, X/Twitter, Slack, Discord,
// iMessage/Applebot, etc.) here instead of the normal SPA shell, because
// those crawlers read raw HTML once and never execute the JavaScript that
// would otherwise inject these tags via React Helmet.
//
// This mirrors the route table in src/components/seo/RouteSEOInjector.tsx
// so crawler previews match what users actually see once the page loads.
// Keep both in sync when adding new top-level routes.
//
// Access at: /api/og?path=/some/route  (middleware.ts sets this query param)

// link, so the destination is always correct even though the preview
// text is generic for those specific pages.
